Hello! Welcome to my personal website!

## Introduction
As I have little experience with web development, this project required me to learn html, css, and the React.js framework. I designed all the components without using any external library like Material UI, and almost exclusively used the flex display type for all of them. While I was originally planning to do this throughout my summer break, I ended up completing it in less than 2 weeks!

## Responsive Design
I worked hard to ensure that the website looks good regardless of the screen it is viewed in. For example, this is how the home and project pages look like when viewed in a landscape screen:
 <div>
  <img width="800" src="https://github.com/knowyourenemy/personal_website/blob/master/src/assets/images/screenshots/home-landscape.png" alt="Website home page    landscape">
  <img width="800" src="https://github.com/knowyourenemy/personal_website/blob/master/src/assets/images/screenshots/projects-landscape.png" alt="Website projects page landscape">
</div>

And this is how they look when viewed in a portriat screen:
<div>
  <img width="200" src="https://github.com/knowyourenemy/personal_website/blob/master/src/assets/images/screenshots/home-portrait.png" alt="Website home page portrait">
  <img width="200" src="https://github.com/knowyourenemy/personal_website/blob/master/src/assets/images/screenshots/projects-portrait.png" alt="Website projects page portriat">
</div>

## Future Plans
I plan to add an 'experiences' section which will display my education and work experiences, and an 'interests section' which will elaborate on my passion for animals and music, and possibly even include a photo gallery.
